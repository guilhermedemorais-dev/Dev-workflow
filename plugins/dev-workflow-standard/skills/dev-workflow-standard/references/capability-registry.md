# Engineering Capability Registry

The registry maps engineering needs to preferred capabilities and safe fallbacks.
It is a routing contract, not a list of mandatory calls. Invoke only capabilities
that are relevant to the current checkpoint.

This exact registry is a local architectural extension. Capability-based
routing is a broader agent pattern, but the names, rows, priorities, and
fallback rules below are owned by this repository.

This registry routes capability to owner skill. Each specialist owns its
versioned `references/tool-registry.json` and ignored local runtime state;
see `skill-owned-tools.md`. Do not centralize vendor installation here.

## Core Registry

## Routing Rules

### Research and reference routing

Before external Discovery/SDD research, inspect this registry, the active
Environment MCP Library and actual host tools. Resolve connected/available
capabilities, not merely names in a catalog. Prefer the narrowest suitable
MCP/connector when it can satisfy the question; do not default to generic web
search while a sufficient specialized capability is available.

| Research need | Preferred available route | Bounded fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Existing project facts/reuse | required project sources and repository tools; existing context retrieval when additional context is needed | local file/symbol search |
| Library/SDK versioned documentation and API examples | Context7 or an equivalent documentation MCP | official version-matched documentation |
| Public implementation examples | official Grep MCP or GitHub code search, under SDD public-code discovery rules | original public repositories/search website |
| Repository files, commits, tests and license | GitHub repository/file tools | authorized source checkout or original public file |
| Known dependency advisories and preventive security requirements | `security-standard`: OSV public advisory/API through a suitable available capability; versioned ASVS controls | official source records or approved local/offline audit, with coverage limits |
| Page extraction/crawl needed for a reference | available Firecrawl or equivalent extraction MCP | bounded page fetch; browser only when interaction is required and authorized |
| General discovery of primary sources | available purpose-fit search MCP/connector discovered from the host/catalog | generic web search, then original sources |

These are routing examples, not an exhaustive fixed inventory or mandatory
calls to every vendor. Context7 does not replace code inspection; extraction
does not prove application behavior. Search only what the current uncertainty
needs. Follow owner instructions and required source reads.

Record actual capability used, source/version, question answered and limitations
in the existing research evidence/report. On fallback, record why the suitable
specialized route was unavailable, failed or insufficient. Do not claim a MCP
ran without invocation output. An optional missing MCP is not a blocker when
the fallback provides equivalent evidence. Route requested preparation through
Environment; never install/connect all catalog entries to perform research.

Reuse reference records, retrieve narrow sections/snippets and avoid repeatedly
loading whole pages. MCP response content still consumes model context/tokens;
do not promise token-free research or unmeasured savings. Keep host status/logs
in evidence rather than adding runtime state to normative Task JSON.

### General routing

1. Resolve the need, not merely a product name.
2. Prefer the narrowest capability that owns the work.
3. Do not invoke unrelated specialists to create ceremony.
4. Mandatory specialist triggers cannot be replaced by generic reasoning.
5. A fallback must satisfy the same task contract, permissions, scope and
   validation requirements as the preferred capability.
6. If no safe fallback exists, return `BLOCKED` with the missing capability.
7. Do not create parallel implementations when switching executors.
8. Reuse prior valid outputs and receipts instead of restarting finished stages.
9. Use `context-routing.md` for the sector/phase handoff and purpose-based
   source loading. A tool's technical owner is not necessarily the owner of
   the functional conclusion; QA may use shared tools without copying registries.

### Functional QA

Invoke `qa-testing-standard` for behavior changes, bugfixes, user flows, API
behavior, business rules, persistent state, payments, multi-tenant behavior,
imports/exports, integrations, concurrency, state machines and regressions.
Docs-only, metadata-only or administrative changes without runtime behavior
may be N/A with a reason. Pure visual changes retain UI validation even if
functional QA is N/A. Do not silently replace independent QA with the coder.
Planning scenarios may precede implementation; final QA requires executable
artifacts and current dependency receipts. QA owns behavior; Security owns
vulnerability confirmation, UI owns visual quality, DevOps owns operations.

## Runtime Availability

Use the environment skill's `status` fast path before depending on prepared
capabilities. Missing/broken prerequisites route to selective `prepare`/`repair`,
then return here to invoke the specialist. Never replace its receipt with an
environment health report. Provider knowledge lives in the portable MCP Library,
not a hardcoded developer inventory. Preserve registration/installation/
connection/authentication distinctions; host evidence has bounded freshness.

Before invoking a capability, determine whether it is available through the
current environment:

- installed skill
- connected plugin/MCP/tool
- executable script/CLI
- authorized executor LLM/runtime

For an executor LLM, resolve the owner skill first and then follow
`provider-routing.md`. A configured API key or TOML block is not availability;
probe the runtime and preserve provider/model evidence. When additional project
context is needed after normative sources are loaded, use
`context-retrieval.md`. Retrieval supplements required sources and never
expands scope or authorization.

If the desired capability is not actually available, do not pretend it ran. Use
the fallback policy or block explicitly.

## Specialist Trigger Summary

### DevOps and environment boundary

Repository onboarding, settings, labels, Projects and rules belong to DevOps,
using its `references/github-governance.md` and deterministic helper. Environment
only prepares Git/gh. Bootstrap before the first applicable Task; reuse compatible
evidence until drift/change/failure/request. No new owner, installer or auth flow.
Only fresh verification can justify readiness; a plan, CLI version or generated
workflow is not evidence of remote enforcement or successful CI.

Invoke `devops-standard` for operational infrastructure, not ordinary source
edits or a basic git status/diff/fetch/commit/PR. Advanced Git history rewriting,
release policy/tags and GitOps require DevOps. Application code stays with
implementation. AppSec/scanners remain with security; IAM, secrets, TLS,
firewall, public ports and elevated privilege mandate its review.

When `dev-environment-standard` exists and is available, it detects/prepares
missing tools/MCPs and returns to DevOps for operations. It never operates
production. Both plugins are included in this repository; runtime availability
and authentication require separate evidence. If unavailable, use `tool-state.py` with an
explicit owner-selected, approved official install only if necessary, not a
replacement bootstrapper/MCP catalog. Do not confuse registered/configured,
installed, connected, authenticated and successfully executed capabilities.

### UI/UX

Invoke `ui-ux-standard` when work changes screens, components, layout,
responsiveness, accessibility, interaction states or design-system behavior.

### SEO / AEO / GEO

Invoke `seo-standard` for landing pages, institutional websites, service pages
and small ecommerce work where search readiness, answer-engine readiness,
schema, search intent or conversion copy materially affects delivery. Use it as
a delivery gate before handoff when SEO readiness is in scope. Backlink,
reputation and competitor work are secondary and should be invoked only when
relevant to the Task.

### Security

Invoke `security-standard` when work touches authentication, authorization,
sessions, tokens, secrets, sensitive data, uploads, payments, parsers, webhooks,
external integrations, tenant isolation, infrastructure or privileged
operations.

### Specs

Invoke `sdd-spec-factory` before implementation of non-trivial product work,
according to the main workflow gates.

### Implementation

Invoke `dev-implementation-standard` only after its task/spec preconditions are
satisfied. The harness remains responsible for observing execution state and
validating the returned result.
